## Abstract
The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) is the satellite instrument on board the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite launched on 13 October 2017.  Data products include column estimates of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide, among others, and feature unprecedented high spatial resolution. These new data products provide opportunities to gain detailed insights into emissions and their sources on scales previously not feasible. We present results from five student teams investigating TROPOMI observations in a semester-long statistical and machine learning analysis practicum under the joint guidance of an atmospheric scientist and statistician. The analysis follows agile practices, where initial results inform the next analysis step. The focus is on the United States, specifically the investigation of methane emissions from natural gas production in key geological basins.
