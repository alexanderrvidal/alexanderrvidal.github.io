Poster presentation (session [CL4.16.2 *Climate tipping points, critical thresholds and ecosystem resilience*](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/posters/33082 "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/posters/33082")) at the EGU General Assembly 2019 in Vienna, Austria.

## Abstract
Holding more than half of Earth’s freshwater at present, the Antarctic Ice Sheet is by far the largest source of future sea-level rise with a potential of raising the mean elevation of the oceans by nearly 60 meters globally. Despite comparably low rates of Antarctic sea-level contribution at present, this poses a serious threat to coastal populations and ecosystems on centennial and millennial time scales under global warming. Yet, large uncertainties flaw our knowledge of Antarctica’s long-term stability and future behavior—among them a lack of quantification of Antarctic tipping points.

Using the thermomechanically-coupled shallow ice model PISM, we investigate critical thresholds in global mean temperature for the Antarctic ice basins, and present the continental ice-sheet hysteresis.
