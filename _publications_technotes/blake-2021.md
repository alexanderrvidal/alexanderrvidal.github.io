## Abstract
We implement a parallel version of the Multi-resolution Approximation (MRA) in Matlab for distributed computing environments. This implementation builds upon and improves our previous Shallow-Tree approach, facilitating computations with data sets on the order of 50 million observations while reducing execution times by up to 75%. We observe less sensitivity to computing cluster and model parameter settings allowing for more flexible specification.
