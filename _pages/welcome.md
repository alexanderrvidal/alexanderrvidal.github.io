Hi, I'm Julius. I am a PhD candidate and researcher in the [Earth System Analysis](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/earth-system-analysis "https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/earth-system-analysis") department at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Germany.

My research focuses on the stability and potential tipping points of the Antarctic ice sheet and their consequences on the long-term sea-level rise under future global warming. The aim of my PhD project is to assess whether the interactions between the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets increase the likelihood that a tipping of the Greenland ice sheet enhances the tipping potential of the Antarctic ice sheet.

At PIK, I am part of the working group on [Ice Dynamics](https://ricarda.science/group "https://ricarda.science/group") led by Ricarda Winkelmann. My work is also embedded in the Leibniz project [DominoES](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/dominoes "https://www.pik-potsdam.de/dominoes") and PIK's [FutureLab on Earth Resilience in the Anthropocene](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/earthresilience "https://www.pik-potsdam.de/earthresilience").
