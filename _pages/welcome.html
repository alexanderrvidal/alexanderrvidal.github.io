<p>Hi, I'm Julius. I am a PhD candidate and researcher in the <a href="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/departments/earth-system-analysis" title="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/departments/earth-system-analysis">Earth System Analysis</a> department at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Germany.</p>

<p>My research focuses on the stability and potential tipping points of the Antarctic ice sheet and their consequences for long-term sea-level rise under future global warming. The aim of my PhD project is to assess whether the interactions between the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets increase the likelihood that a tipping of the Greenland ice sheet enhances the tipping potential of the Antarctic ice sheet.</p>

<p>At PIK, I am part of the working group on <a href="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/ice" title="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/ice">Ice Dynamics</a> led by Prof. Ricarda Winkelmann as well as PIK's FutureLab on <a href="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/earthresilience" title="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/earthresilience">Earth Resilience in the Anthropocene</a>. My work is funded by the Leibniz project <a href="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/dominoes" title="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/dominoes">DominoES</a> on interacting tipping elements in the Earth system and the EU's Horizon 2020 project <a href="https://www.tipaccs.eu" title="https://www.tipaccs.eu">TiPACCs</a> on tipping points in Antarctic climate components.</p>

<p>To get a better idea of my research focus, watch this short introduction video about the TiPACCs project:</p>
