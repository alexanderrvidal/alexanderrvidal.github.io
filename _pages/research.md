## PhD Project
My research focuses on developing spatial statistical tools to analyze massive spatial data. The environmental data sets I work with range from hundreds of thousands up to hundreds of millions. Traditional statistical methods are computationally infeasible for the typical data sizes now generated by remote sensing instruments and numerical models. Moreover, even if computations were feasible, common modeling practices can hinder the scientific utility of these data by imposing unrealistic assumptions. I develop theoretical and practical tools to analyze these data in a computationally efficient manner and capture the complex spatial relationships.


## Research Interests
- Spatial statistics
- High performance computing
- Earth sciences including oceanography, atmospheric science, and climate
