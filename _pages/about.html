  <p>Hi, I'm Alex. I recently completed my PhD at <a
      href="https://www.mines.edu/" title="https://www.mines.edu/">Colorado School of Mines</a> in the <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/"
      title="https://ams.mines.edu/">Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics</a>, where I studied under the supervision of <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/project/wu-fung-samy/" title="https://ams.mines.edu/project/wu-fung-samy/">Dr. Samy Wu Fung</a> and <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/project/tenorio-luis/" title="https://ams.mines.edu/project/tenorio-luis/">Dr. Luis Tenorio</a>.    
    
    <p>Currently, I am a senior data scientist at <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/" title="https://www.nerdwallet.com/">NerdWallet</a> after surviving a successful <a
      href="https://investors.nerdwallet.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nerdwallet-completes-acquisition-barrelhead" title="https://investors.nerdwallet.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nerdwallet-completes-acquisition-barrelhead">exit</a> from fintech startup, On The Barrelhead.  
      Prior to that, I worked at a variety of engineering companies working on practical design problems in engineering and control.</p>

  <p> 
    My research lies in the intersection of deep learning with optimal transport and optimal control to aid in solving practical problems in physics, finance, medicine, and data science.  In particular, I am broadly interested in 
    optimal transport, optimal control, inverse problems, and deep learning.
