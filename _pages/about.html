  <p><strong>Hi, I’m Alex — a machine learning researcher, consultant, and applied mathematician.</strong></p>

  <p>
    I specialize in using deep learning, optimization, and physics-informed modeling to solve real-world problems in science, engineering, and finance. 
    If you’re looking for help building intelligent systems, designing custom ML models, or tackling hard technical challenges with modern AI, I’d love to talk.
  </p>

  <p>I offer consulting services for companies and research teams that need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deep learning and generative modeling expertise</li>
    <li>Physics-informed machine learning</li>
    <li>High-dimensional data modeling (remote sensing, medical imaging, etc.)</li>
    <li>Recommendation systems such as the Two-Tower model, etc
    <li>Optimization, optimal transport, or control methods</li>
    
  </ul>

  <p>
    Whether you're building a prototype, scaling a production ML system, or looking for someone to bridge theory and practice in a difficult domain — 
    I'm available for short- or long-term engagements.
  </p>

  <h2>Research Background</h2>
  <p>
    I recently completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the Colorado School of Mines, 
    where I worked on applying deep learning to problems in physics, optimal control, and high-dimensional data. 
    My dissertation focused on generative models, swarm optimal control, and hyperspectral remote sensing. 
    You may find the associated publications on my google scholar page to the left.
    <-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  </p>

  <p>Some of the key areas I work in include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Optimal transport and inverse problems</li>
    <li>Generative modeling (e.g., normalizing flows, diffusion models)</li>
    <li>Swarm optimal control and robotics</li>
    <li>Remote sensing (e.g., hyperspectral imaging for mineral mapping)</li>
    <li>Recommendation systems (e.g. Two-Tower model, etc)

  </ul>

  <h2>Industry Experience</h2>
<p>
  I’m currently the Senior Machine Learning Researcher at <strong>Launch Potato</strong>, a high-growth fintech startup where I serve as the company’s primary technical resource for all things machine learning. 
  My role goes far beyond implementation — I lead research and development of cutting-edge algorithms tailored specifically to our marketing and lead generation strategies.
  This includes designing novel model architectures, running rigorous experiments, and deploying custom solutions that align with business goals and data constraints.
</p>
    
    During my PhD, I worked for two years as a senior data scientist at <strong> NerdWallet </strong> following the successful acquisition of the fintech startup 
    <strong>On The Barrelhead</strong>, where I was a core contributor. I led projects involving large-scale data, model deployment, and custom algorithm development — 
    experiences that shaped my ability to move fast from prototype to production in real-world environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Prior to this, I worked in engineering-focused roles, developing solutions for control systems and design optimization.
  </p>

  <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
  <p>
    I'm currently open to:
    <ul>
      <li>Consulting collaborations where I can bring research into practice</li>
      <li>Research opportunities in machine learning and applied mathematics</li>
      <li>Research scientist or ML scientist roles at mission-driven organizations</li>

    </ul>
  </p>
