  <p>Hi, I'm Alexander. I am a PhD Candidate at the <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/"
      title="https://ams.mines.edu/">Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics</a> at <a
      href="https://www.mines.edu/" title="https://www.mines.edu/">Colorado School of Mines</a>, studying under the supervision of Dr. Samy Wu Fung and Dr. Luis Tenorio.    
    
    <p>Concurrently, I am also a consulting senior data scientist 
    for companies such as <a href="https://regenexx.com/" title="https://regenexx.com/">Regenexx</a> and startup, On The Barrelhead, where I survived a successful <a

      href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/" title="https://www.nerdwallet.com/">NerdWallet</a>.  Prior to that, I worked at a variety of engineering companies working on practical design problems in engineering and control.</p>

  

  <p> 
    My research lies in the confluence of deep learning with optimal transport and optimal control to aid in solving practical problems in physics, finance, medicine, and data science.  In particular, I am broadly interested in 
    optimal transport, optimal control, inverse problems, and deep learning.
