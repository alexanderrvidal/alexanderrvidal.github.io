    <p>Hi, I'm Lewis. I am an upcoming PhD graduate in Statistics (December 2021) from the <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/" title="https://ams.mines.edu/">Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics</a> at <a href="https://www.mines.edu/" title="https://www.mines.edu/">Colorado School of Mines</a>, USA. I develop spatial statistics tools for analyzing massive spatial data sets to study the Earth system.</p>

    <p>A primary component of my PhD has been as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu/" title="https://ncar.ucar.edu/">National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)</a> in Boulder, Colorado, USA. There I developed and released scalable machine learning models which allow users to compute with hundreds-of-millions of observations and reduced computation times by 75%. Additionally, I produced foundational work for future research by performing statistical analysis of massive satellite data sets on the <a href="https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/computational-systems/cheyenne" title="https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/computational-systems/cheyenne">Cheyenne</a> and <a href="https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/computational-systems/casper" title="https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/computational-systems/casper">Casper</a> HPC systems, identifying global patterns and trends. The experience I garnered in these projects and my studies has solidified my passion for applying computational science and statistics to atmospheric and climate science, and this is a line of work I want to continue. I am currently in search of positions where I can apply my skills to develop a career at the interface of computational science, statistics, and the atmospheric sciences.</p>
