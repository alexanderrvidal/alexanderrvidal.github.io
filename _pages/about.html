    Hi, I'm Alex. I am broadly interested in the intersection of deep learning with optimal transport and optimal control to aid in solving practical problems in physics, finance, medicine, and data science.  In particular, I am broadly interested in 
    optimal transport, optimal control, inverse problems, and deep learning.

    I recently completed my PhD at <a
    href="https://www.mines.edu/" title="https://www.mines.edu/">Colorado School of Mines</a> in the <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/"
    title="https://ams.mines.edu/">Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics</a>, where I studied under the supervision of <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/project/wu-fung-samy/" title="https://ams.mines.edu/project/wu-fung-samy/">Dr. Samy Wu Fung</a> and <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/project/tenorio-luis/" title="https://ams.mines.edu/project/tenorio-luis/">Dr. Luis Tenorio</a>.
    My thesis was on the use of deep learning methods to advance difficult applied problems in physics, such as in the cases of swarm optimal control, the modeling of high-dimensional data using generative models, and the application of remote sensing using hyperspectral data.

    During my PhD, I worked for two years as a senior data scientist at <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/" title="https://www.nerdwallet.com/">NerdWallet</a> after surviving a successful <a
    href="https://investors.nerdwallet.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nerdwallet-completes-acquisition-barrelhead" title="https://investors.nerdwallet.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nerdwallet-completes-acquisition-barrelhead">exit</a> from fintech startup, On The Barrelhead.
    This experience taught me how to handle big data and to develop methods and algorithms that work on difficult problems in fintech. 
    Prior to this, I worked at a variety of engineering companies working on practical design problems in engineering and control.

    <b>I am actively seeking a postdoctoral appointment, research scientist, or machine learning scientist role that aligns with my skillset!</b>
