Hi, I am a Ph.D. candidate and research assistant at the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/) in Potsdam, Germany, working in the *Ice Dynamics & Tipping* group led by [Prof. Dr. Ricarda Winkelmann](https://ricarda.science).

I am currently investigating the interactions between the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica under the scope of future global warming. My aim is to assess the likelihood that a tipping of the Greenland ice sheet influences the tipping potential of the Antarctic ice sheet to eventually answer the question: How does such a tipping cascade impact the future seal-level contribution from Antarctica?

My dissertation is embedded in the project [*DominoES â€“ Domino Effects in the Earth System: Can Antarctica tip climate policy?*](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/dominoes). DominoES is a joint project by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and the [Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences (GESIS)](http://www.gesis.org/en/home/), Cologne, funded by the [Leibniz Association](https://www.leibniz-gemeinschaft.de/en/home/).
