Here are the models I'm currently working with:

The [Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM)](http://pism-docs.org/ "http://pism-docs.org/") is an open-source, high-resolution computer model to simulate the flow of ice sheets and glaciers, which is adopted as a scientific tool by many research groups around the globe.
PISM is jointly developed at the [University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF)](http://www.uaf.edu/ "http://www.uaf.edu/") and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).
