Here are the models I’m currently working with:

## PISM
<a href="http://pism-docs.org/"><img style="padding: 15px; float: right;" src="/images/logo_pism.png" width="150"></a>
The [Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM)](http://pism-docs.org/ "http://pism-docs.org/") is an open-source, high-resolution computer model to simulate the flow of ice sheets and glaciers, which is adopted as a scientific tool by many research groups [around the globe](https://pism-docs.org/wiki/doku.php?id=projects#where_are_pism_users "https://pism-docs.org/wiki/doku.php?id=projects#where_are_pism_users").
PISM is jointly developed at the [University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF)](http://www.uaf.edu/ "http://www.uaf.edu/") and the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/ "http://www.pik-potsdam.de/").
