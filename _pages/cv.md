## Experience
- **Senior Data Scientist**, [On The Barrelhead / NerdWallet](www.nerdwallet.com), October 2021 - Present
  - *Working group:* Credit Cards and Lending
  * Used data science to solve problems and help make business decisions:
  * Lead implementation of recommender algorithms for all credit card pages.  
  * Predictive modeling to help determine correct product or flow.
  * Portfolio optimization to help determine optimal ratio of products to sell to users.
  * Generative modeling to bolster class-imbalanced datasets with additional synthetic data.
 
- **Chief Data Scientist**, [Rigorous Machine Learning Solutions, LLC](), October 2022 - Present
  * Consulted on predictive data modeling projects for [Regenexx](https://www.regenexx.com/), [Verra](https://www.verra.ai/), and On The Barrelhead (before starting full-time as a senior data scientist).

- **National Science Foundation (NSF) Intern, USGS**, June 2021-August 2021
  * Worked with the USGS hyperspectral team to collect hyperspectral data for more accurate predictive analysis.

- **Graduate Research Assistant**, [CASERM](https://caserm.mines.edu/), 2019 - 2021
  * Collected two different types of mineralogical data and applied image recognition techniques in order to
reconcile the two datasets.
  * A preprocessing step was applied that uses convolutional neural networks to "mask‚Äù the data that is not useful.
  * A stochastic autoencoder (SAE) is used to 'mix' the data used from different sources a latent space.
  * Neural network is used to allow for prediction of one dataset given the other.

- **Data Science Intern**, [Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink)](https://www.lumen.com/), June 2019 - August 2019
  - *Working Group:* Finance
  * Classified pdf documents using deep learning and natural language processing (NLP).
    
- **Teaching Assistant**, [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/), 2018-2021
  * *Classes:* MATH534/535: Mathematical Statistics, MATH537: Multivariate Analysis, MATH536: Advanced Statistical Modeling, MATH225: Differential Equations.
