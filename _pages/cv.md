## Experience
- **Senior Data Scientist**, [On The Barrelhead / NerdWallet](www.nerdwallet.com), October 2021 - Present

  - *Working group:* Credit Cards and Lending
 
- **Chief Data Scientist**, [Rigorous Machine Learning Solutions, LLC](), October 2022 - Present

  * Consulted on various contract projects.

- **Graduate Research Assistant**, [CASERM](https://caserm.mines.edu/), 2019 - 2021

  * Worked on a project that requires collecting two different types of mineralogical data and applying image recognition techniques in order to
reconcile the two datasets. A preprocessing step is applied that uses convolutional neural networks to "mask‚Äù the data that is not useful. Following the preprocessing, neural network modeling are used to allow for prediction of one dataset given the other.
